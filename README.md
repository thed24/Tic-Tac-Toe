# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple two-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe based within a console! This was my first piece of code written in C#.

# Instructions
To play, either compile the source code in Visual Studio or any other C# IDE, or download the executable file in the releases category on this repo and launch it. Once you launch it, you will be able to play straight away! 

# Rules
The rules are simple: Each player takes turns placing either an *X* or an *O* on the board, until either player wins, or they both draw. To win, three of your symbols (X or O) must line up.
